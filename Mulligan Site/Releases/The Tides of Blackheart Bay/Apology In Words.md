# Apology In Words

---

Just take a breath and inhale this cold  
One last goodbye for a heart of stone  
And if broken promises are all you know  
then why can't I just let you go?

Would it help if I said I was sorry?  
To hear from my throat that I miss you so  
Here's the words, I'm sorry (you're sorry)  
just come running back and never let me go. (never let this go)

With a glance to my past I keep walking on  
away from tonight and from all I want  
I'll take this broken glass from the bottle I've found  
and slide it under the skin of my arm.

And if you want to know how we stand  
then follow the drops of blood on this beaches sand  
I'm still waiting to be washed away  
in these raging tides of Blackheart Bay.
