# Second String

---

This is the worst I think I've ever felt and it shows no signs of fading. 
And just the way you have everything else fades away. 
Cause I'm hit or miss and what's wrong with it? 
I was on the outside things don't seem to change that girl 
and so we're hit or miss and what's wrong with it? 
Well, I don't know why things won't change for me. 
So why is everything...why is everything like this 
so gray and far away? She knows things disappear... I need her here. 
She's hit or miss and what's wrong with it? 
If I was on the outside things don't seem to change that girl 
and so we're hit or miss and what's wrong with it? 
I don't know why things won't change for me. 
So I'm hit or miss and what's wrong with it? 
If it was on the outside things don't seem to change girl 
and so we're hit or miss and what's wrong with it? 
I don't know why things won't change for me.
