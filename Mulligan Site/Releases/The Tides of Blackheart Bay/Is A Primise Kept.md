# Is A Primise Kept

---

we both knew this was wrong, but we tried  
picture me breaking down, on my hands and knees

yeah, we both knew this was wrong, but we tried  
(my promise to you has become)  
picture my breaking down under your sheets  
(just a bend in the road)

forget this all  
or just sing along  
cause i've wrote you off  
and you've you wrote this down

and my promise is, on bending knees  
that this will make you see...this will make you see  
this so you never have to know  
that im singing alone

we both knew this is wrong  
(I will move on)  
its the flow of the tide  
but we try  
(you will always)  
its a bend in the road  
i think we should both be  
(be the one who)  
its the lights in the sky  
be hiding our eyes  
its a movement for lips to collide  
(stays the same)  
to see the holes we've dug

its a movement for lips to collide  
(I will move on)  
To see the world fall down  
its a movement for lips to collide  
(you will always)  
To see us both in love  
its a movement for lips to collide  
(be the one who)  
To see you fall out  
its a movement for lips to collide  
(stays the same)  
To see you fall out

...A promise made, is a promise kept...
