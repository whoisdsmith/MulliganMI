# Tuesday We Have Fun

---

Settle down and say goodbye  
You took your last try  
to say the words you thought were right  
You should have lied.

Does it matter what's going on?  
Does it matter what they say?  
Does it matter that I've been there for you every step of the way?  
(you sell out and then give in)

Settle down and say so long  
You took a bit too long  
to say the words you thought were right  
You should have lied

Aren't you listening? Goodbye.
