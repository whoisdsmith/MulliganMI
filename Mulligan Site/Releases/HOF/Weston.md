## Weston

When I drive home late at night, 
well I try to think of reasons to help you sleep at night
with your eyes and I kiss them closed for you. 
You can wonder why if I lied and you'd never know the truth. 

If you stabbed me in the heart, would I bleed all over you
exhiled. I'd love to know the truth. 
I'd lie outside at night and stare straight up at you. 
You still can't sleep at night with your eyes 
and I kissed them closed for you. 
You think of reasons why that you lied 
and I'll never know the truth. 

Try to find my eyes in the sky
and I'll stare straight down at you. 
Tell your lies
exhiled. I'm watching over you. 

I lie outside at night and stare straight up at you. 
I try sometimes to live 'til I die, but not without you. 
Until your life then in time I'm watching over you. T
ry sometimes to find…like I've never met you. 
Lie outside at night…I stare straight up at you. 
So I know the truth. So I know the truth.
