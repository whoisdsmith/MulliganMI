Decide what you want and I'll try to find a way. 
Know nothing about it at all. 
Decide what you thought was right last night. 
Well, some things are better left unsaid. 
But I am whatever she wants me to be. 
I can be just about anything. 
Decide what you thought was right or just a lie. 
I'll find out why. 
I know nothing about why I am pretty much nothing at all. 
Yet, I am whatever she wants me to be. 
I can be just about anything. 
I am... 
Sometimes I forget why I need more. 
But I am whatever she wants me to be. 
I can be just about anything. 
I am what midnight desires me to be. 
I can be just about anything at all.
