# Every Other Pedal Spells Disaster

---

Take this down  
you might never find  
regrets of a worse kind  
These are not roses  
these are thoughts from friends  
And this is our goodbye  
and your story's end

I'll grab myself a rose from up in front  
Limb from limb tear it apart  
This one means more than "she loves me not"  
And every other petal spells your gone, your gone

Let each blink  
wipe the slate clean  
Tears make new marks it seems  
These are not roses  
These are thoughts from friends  
And I'm standing alone  
counting petals again

I'll grab myself a rose from up in front  
(as we stand around your grave we know we'll always think of you)  
Limb from limb tear it apart  
(Quietly asking, "How could this have happened?")  
This one means more than "she loves me not"  
(As we stand around your grave you know we'll always miss you)  
And every other petal spells your gone, your gone.  
(How could you take your life with you own hands?)

disaster, oh  
(I can't believe it)  
disaster  
(I won't believe it)
