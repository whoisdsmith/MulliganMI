# Collateral
---

We Brought This New Year In Together 
while She Was Bringing This To An End

These Are Windows To Souls
These Are Eyes And I'm Closing Mine
I'm Closing Mine

We're Standing In The Garden 
With Our Friends All Gazing Through The Window 
Planning What They're Going To Do This Year

This Is Apartment Is Cold But It Smells Like Home
And You Feel Like Home You Feel Like Home

So I'm Your Collateral And You're Scared
We Wage Our Own Wars In Our Bedrooms
Under Drawn Sheets, Behind Lock Doors, 
Like Secrets Kept

So I Will Raise My Glass And Toast To This Brand New Year
As We Try To Figure It Out For Ourselves

This Apartment Is Small, So Lets Hit The Road
10 Seconds To Go, Here We Go

Now I'm Your Collateral And You're Scared
We Wage Our Own Wars In Our Bedrooms
Under Drawn Sheets, Behind Lock Doors, 
Like Secrets Kept
