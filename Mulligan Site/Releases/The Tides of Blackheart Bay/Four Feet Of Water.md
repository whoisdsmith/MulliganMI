# Four Feet Of Water

---

It always rains, but where we are this cold makes snow  
Don't make this a waste, get the water in your lungs  
I fear that what I've wanted most is coming true  
I've got a letter in my right hand, I can't read to you

It said all you've ever wanted from me, you know.  
I have convinced myself to never speak these words out.  
I will only write them down. I will only carve them on  
the walls in my bedroom, replace the pictures I've torn down.

And I feel these lungs are burning, from breaths being held.  
Am I just outlines? Or should I let this air out?

But this sunset is killing me.  
It's all the colors that I think I see.  
I'm thinking of a war's retreat  
with this red and orange on a reflecting sea.

It was a battle that the moon won  
with its stars fighting a blood red sun  
But the night sky sends it down to you  
and this valley that we stand in too.

And I feel these lungs burn, from breaths being held.  
Am I just outlines? Or should I let this air out?

So lets not even try,  
Worthless challenge and prize.

And I feel these lungs are burning, from breaths being held.  
Am I just outlines? Or should I let this air out?
