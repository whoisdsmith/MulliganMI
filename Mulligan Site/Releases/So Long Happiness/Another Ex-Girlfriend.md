# Another Ex-Girlfriend

---

Something made me say that I want out. 
It's been this way a long time and I bow down 
every time she comes around I'm gone. 
Why I need to hold on. 
When I say I'm on my own, try. 
I am all done and I'm... 
When I say I'm on my last try this time. 
(I can't get it all right. She used to be mine. 
This is so true. Why can't she be mine?) 
Another ex-girlfriend. 
Another ex-girlfriend comes along. 
Another ex-girlfriend. 
Another ex-girlfriend comes along. 
When I say I'm on my own, try. 
I am all gone and I'm... 
When I say I'm on my last try this time. 
Another ex-girlfriend. 
Another ex-girlfriend comes along. 
Another ex-girlfriend. 
Another ex-girlfriend comes along. 
Another ex-girlfriend.
