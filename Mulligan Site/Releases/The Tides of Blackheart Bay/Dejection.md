# Dejection

---

Your eyes tonight are almost as blue as I feel inside  
And you have no idea what you've done  
My hands are tingling now, maybe it's just because  
my heart has been broken, or maybe I can finally see

If you fight the good fight, then maybe I can finally see  
(I feel myself giving out) Yeah I'm fighting, but I'm losing  
If you fight the good fight, then maybe I can finally see

It's just like the rest of me. It's inefficient and lacking things  
This dejection is all I have to remember of her,  
as if I could forget. I can't fill my lungs

If you fight the good fight, I can't fill my lungs  
(I feel myself giving out) Yeah I'm fighting, but I'm losing  
If you fight the good fight, I can't fill my lungs
