# Green Eyes

---

With your green eyes staring right back at mine, 
I cannot help but to find that I do not deserve 
no way should I receive all this sea that I see. 
Only partial memories remain of my life, 
only partial memories remain...your green eyes. 
You would know before anyone that I don't lie. 
I cannot recall anything other than your eyes. 
Only partial memories remain of my life, 
only partial memories remain...your green eyes. 
Only partial memories remain of my life, 
only partial memories remain, and your green eyes.
