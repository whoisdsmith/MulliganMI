# Tinfoil

---

Smiling with wide eyes  
and little white lies tucked inside  
You're screaming you love me outside  
with crossed fingers behind  
Just tell me how you wanted me to make you feel  
'Cause I would try to make this real.  
As real as this tinfoil heart you hold.

Just tell me how you want to live  
Are we at least close  
Anything you say  
I'd take it right to the post  
Just tell me how you wanted me to feel  
Cause I would try  
to make your tinfoil heart mine

If you're the liar now, then what am I to do?  
Just stand beside you after all that we've been through?

(but you're all of me and I can't let go,  
I don't regret a single word I spoke)
