# Exploitation

## Exploitation

Never learned a thing at all in high school, 
except the way she smiled with her eyes 
and her hair smelled so nice. 
Never had more in mind then a smile and a wave, 
although me as a brave knight in shining armor would be nice. 

Don't pick on me, cause I don't understand 
why her lines are all about me. 
Don't pick on me, cause I don't understand
why her lies are coming back to bite me. 

Here sits a man with a plan. 
He knows how to get revenge. 
He knows how to be the one where 
all the bright lights are. 
He sits and comprehends 
all the styles and the bends 
in every single curve she owns.
