# Australia

---

So you've made up your mind as to what you want? 
Can you spare me the line of all the things you've thought of? 
So what's the problem? What's wrong this time? 
Could you leave yourself without going outside? 
Would you like me to leave, not waste your time? 
You should get on a plane and fly to Australia; 
I'll see you there. I'll sing our song a million miles away 
and I will hear you. 
You deserve so much more (4x). 
Hey what's the problem? What's wrong this time? 
Could you leave yourself without going outside? 
I could leave and not waste any of your time. 
Or I could get on a plane and fly to Australia; 
I'll see you there. I could sing our song a million miles away 
and pretend I hear you. 
You deserve so much more (4x). 
Hey what's the problem? What's wrong this time? 
I could leave and not waste your life. I could leave tonight. 
Or we could get on a plane and fly to Australia; 
I'll see you there. I could sing our song a million miles away and pretend I hear you.
