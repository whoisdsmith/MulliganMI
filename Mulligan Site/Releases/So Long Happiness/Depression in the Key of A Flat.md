# Depression in the Key of A Flat

---

It's raining outside my star-lit room. 
It's raining outside my star-lit room and where are you? 
It's always like this. I'm left standing. There's nothing I can do. 
I'm cold and without you. I'm always... 
Wish there was something - loving, happiness or hurting. 
Nothing is better than anything and that's what I feel. 
So this is heartbreak? 
What all of the songs I love have come to be about? 
What is she all about? 
I wish that I could say the words you understand. 
I still do not understand the words I feel. 
This is awful and I do know I hurt you. 
If I was the last man standing nothing in our way, 
would I be good enough then to warrant another day? 
I'm all alone. Do you feel anything at all? Do you feel anything?
