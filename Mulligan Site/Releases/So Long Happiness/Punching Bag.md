# Punching Bag

---

Two minutes too late. It's ten after eight 
and you're already gone away and 
I look at the clock. It's all that I see 
and I think back to how it used to be 
before all of this had occurred 
because of three unspoken words...
unspoken words. 

Go ahead and go away. 
Go ahead and I'll just stay and 
I will always be your punching bag. (I'd never sell you out.) 
You never ever say a thing. 
How is this happening to me? 
I will always be your punching bag. (I'd never sell you out.)
