# Kill Devil Hills

---

Tonight I'm drinking away your memory  
And what everyone else fails to see  
is that these bottles can become razor blades  
You can use them to drag across your veins  
as a cry for help

But I'm through holding on  
So just crush those thoughts  
And my arms feel more empty than heavy  
That's just the drug in your drink  
and thinking back, this was the least I could have done

You can take my heart  
you can break my arms  
you can even have my eyes  
but you will never have it all  
at least not while I'm alive.

But I have hopes for a new start  
With these dividing lines between us still  
I need more than just miles  
I need something I can grab  
Something I can hold in one hand  
and use to swing like hell

Is it in the air?  
Or just the water you drank?  
Can you feel your eyes  
becoming heavy as I think  
What have I done?

But I know this all will turn out right  
right as rain, right as rain comes down on us.
