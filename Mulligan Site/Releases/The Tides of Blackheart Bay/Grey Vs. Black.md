# Grey Vs. Black

---

If this is not enough  
to start a fire in your heart  
can it put one out?  
The coals are always red  
under this black and gray you'll learn  
So just open up your eyes  
'cause right in front of them I'll burn

This is all your fault  
That all the fires in their eyes  
are burning out  
Given everything, your love has turned to dust

You think you'd learn  
that anyone else would have  
turned and walked away.

Well you know that I have been waiting all my life  
for anyone to change these black skies  
I'd give all my love  
I'd give all my hope  
Please, can anyone make this right?  
Or make it rain?  
Well can you make it rain?  
Can you make this right?  
Can anyone?  
Right before I knew, you were not the same.
