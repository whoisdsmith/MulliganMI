## Tuesday

Settle down & say goodbye. 
You always took your last try 
to say the words you thought were right, 
but you should have lied. 
I just want your love. 

Doesn't matter what's going on.
Doesn't matter what they say. 
Doesn't matter that I was there for you 
every step of the way. 
Doesn't matter what's going on. 
Doesn't matter what they say. 
Doesn't matter that I was there for you 
every step of the way. 

Want to tell you that I miss you
and I hope things will go your way
Step of the way
Are you listening â€“ goodbye. 

Goodbye So Long
