# This Distance In Miles

---

What if everything that you see  
brought you straight back home to me?  
would you be willing to say  
"This distance is killing me?"

If you find me late tonight  
with this vague and failing sight  
this dagger in my throat reads  
"This distance will divide you and me"

And if you drive  
you can follow these safe lines home  
If you drive  
follow these same lines to my door

this distance in miles
