# The Key Of A Flat

---

It's raining  
outside my starlit room  
and where are you?  
It's always like this  
I'm always waiting on you  
I'm always,

And I'm trying  
the best that I know how  
but you don't care  
But anything is better  
is better than nothing  
and that's all I feel.

That's all I feel  
And I'm still waiting  
I am still waiting
