# One Thousand & One

## One Thousand & One

She lies there next to you, wearing a one of a kind suit. 
The one her parents contributed to 18 years ago 
(she thinks her flaws would always bring her down). 
She says it has its flaws. You never seem to notice. 
You always seem to find the words that seem to make her perfect 
(and all alone an 18 year old cries). 
It's January again, seems like it's always been,
but this will never change
just like you 
(you'll never change you'll always stay the same) 
Now my hands are chapped. 
Breaking, bleeding and bend and then they snap.
Salt gets poured into the wound and I can't clap (but I try)
So give me shattered glass eyes, 
so I can't realize I love you, 
and I will never move on. 
Give me shattered glass eyes 
so I realize I need you and I miss you, right now. 
She bites and tugs my lip. 
I pull her even closer. 
These moments are few and far between. 
About 36 more hours to live again.  
(I tried and I tried so hard) 
Stand there in front of her, foreheads pressed together. 
Coarse to touch just like a coffin and eyes are like daggers 
(don't get hit, stay low).
