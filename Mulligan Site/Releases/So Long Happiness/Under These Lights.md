# Under These Lights

---

I look in your room. I look at your wall. 
The first week of school the pictures you've drawn 
and I recall the day...the day that I met you. 

You made my best friend cry like never before, 
rolling around that department store. 
(I'm stronger now that you're gone.) 

Weeks went by without me calling you. 
Well, I was scared of what you'd say. 
I thought that you would call me names. 
I thought that you would turn away. 

You made my best friend cry like never before, 
rolling around that department store. 

Well, there's no bridges to cross, no mountains to climb. 
There's no lives to be lost. No contracts to sign.
