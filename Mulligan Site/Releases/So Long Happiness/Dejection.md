# Dejection

---

Your eyes tonight...they're almost as blue as I felt inside. 
She had no idea what she'd done.
My hands are tingling now. 
Maybe it's just because my heart has been broken 
or I can finally see. 

Fight the good fight. 
See that my hands fight the good fight. 
She's always gone. 
Just like the rest of me - inefficient and lacking things. 
Dejection is all I have to remember, as if I could forget. 
I cannot fill this space in my lungs. 
Fight the good fight just to see what she wants. 
Fight the good fight. She's always gone. 

This is killing me.
