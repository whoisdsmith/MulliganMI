# The Sound Of Pages Turning

---

Are we really all done now? How did we ever end up like this?  
How can something as small as seven states tear us down, or was it always gone?  
I told you I'd be a good uncle. And a friend, stand brothers in arms.  
And I will, I swear it I will never let you down there's three of us in this song

You're still our brother, although you're not here. We'll carry this flag for you.

This doesn't feel right, brothers shouldn't fight.  
This used to make us feel alive.  
We're screaming on packed nights, you'd sing along when it felt right.  
This used to make us feel alive.

Please someone turn the lights off. I can't stare at empty seats.  
I can't breath. I can't move. I can't play.  
Remember the very first time? We thought forming a band would save our lives.  
We were 3 hearts beating in breakdowns, now they're breaking in 4/4 time.  
I can see this isn't what you want. But you're the man of the house now.  
We'll be around. & We'll help bring Everett up.

You'll never be replaced here. It's just different cymbals ringing in our ears.  
It's just a different friend with us on stage. It's just like everything has changed.
