# Heartbroken & Musically Inclined

---

Just last night, as I tried to tell you I lied. 
Last night as I tried to tell you, I tried. 
I took a lonesome walk outside. 
Saw the stars and I thought of your eyes. 
I've got pictures on my bedroom floor. 
Reminders of the way we were before 
she went away and changed my mind. 
The less I try, the more I gain sometimes. 
Tried so hard to be on my way. 
She left me now. 
So what's one more broken heart? 
On top of all the lies you told me, 
and all the words I still believe are true? 
I fall apart and you...you lied to me, 
and I believed every word. 
I believed every word.
