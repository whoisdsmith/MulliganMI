## Hearts on Fire

Let me tell you from the start. 
The story of a broken heart 
and the lives it changed 
that can never stay the same. 

There's 2 black holes in the sky tonight,
where stars would once shine. 
It looks like they've gone 
to rejoin the fight in your eyes. 
Feel like I'm stabbed in the throat. 
Can't say the words you want spoke. 
Can't take you to places that you want to see. 
Feel like I'm stabbed in the throat. 
Can't say the words you want spoke. 
I can never be the man you want to see 
and when I tell you where to go  

the places that you should know. 
You get lost on all the roads that lead you home. 
How many times will this take? 
How many more will break? 
Ten thousand's all I'll give. 
How many times will this need? 
And will you lead me, if I'm drowning and this heart's on fire? 
And when I'm goneâ€¦
